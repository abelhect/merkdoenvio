# merkdoenvio
My first attempt at a business website.
It is a simple website in spanish for a business idea that never went operational.
It was designed using adobe photoshop for the art, colors and picture. I used MSVisio to wireframe the site first. I used bootstrap to helpme with the configuration of the site. Then i learned basic PHP and MySQL to create the registration system and the user login system. It is an operational site hosted in a free hosting service.
It was built for learning purposes only. You can see the site at www.merkdoenvio.x10host.com.
